# VXVSUnpacker

A quick and dirty extraction tool for Gameloft's VXVS files.

Extracts WAV files from VXVS.

Does not yet interpret the metadata properly, it will once that has been fully reverse engineered.

Use Windows Media Player (the old one) to open the WAV files. The new Media Player can't read all the output WAV files (it might not support all WAV codecs)
